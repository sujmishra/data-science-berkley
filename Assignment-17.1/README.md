# Problem
We have [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) from direct marketing campaigns(phone calls) from a Portugese banking institution. 

The goal of this project is to perform a comparative evaluation of the following classifiers 

* K Nearest Neighbors 
* Logistic Regression 
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines

During this evaluation the models will be compared on the following criteria 

* Training Time
* Training Accuracy 
* Test Accuracy 

Aditionally hyperparameter tuning of the models will be performed in order to adjust and gain the best performance metrics.

# Business Objective 
The dataset contains data collected using 17 directed marketing campaigns using a self owned contact center between May 2008 and November 2010. The dominant marketing channel was telephone , however some of the data was captured using internet banking channel.
A total of 79354 contacts were made and an attractive long-term deposit application, with good interest rates, was offered. For each contact, 20 input attributes and 1 output attribute were stored. For the whole database considered, there were 6499
successes (8% success rate).

The business goal of this problem is to predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on the marketing campaign and what factors contribute towards the acceptance of a subscription. The marketing campaigns could then be targeted towards individuals with factors that are more likely to subscribe to the term deposit.
