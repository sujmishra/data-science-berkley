## Research Question
**Which lifestyle factors such as diet exercise etc can be used to predict the 
risk of diabetes?**


# Business Objective 

This research can help address a significant public health problem. If it can be shown that lifestyle factors (which can be modified) have a significant contribution in predicting risk of diabetes, then public health programs can be targeted towards certain empowering people to control diabetes through lifestyle changes.

As per https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html 40.1 million people(12% of the population) are diabetic. Since a very large population of 115.2 million are pre-diabetic , targeted intervention can help contain this risk. This will could reduce the burden of this disease on Americans.
